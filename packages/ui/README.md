# UI

This package is responsible for UI components.

Ideally this will have seperate components for "Card", "Deck", "Scoreboard".

As well as any other components that might be useful. This could include
user notifications, game room login UI elements, and any other UI component.

This package will be consumed by the `web-ui` package for rendering.

Since this is a small project, I might just setup all the components in the
`web-ui` app as I don't think they will be re-used in the admin app.
