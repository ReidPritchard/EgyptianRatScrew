# Logger

This was just part of the monorepo template and doesn't serve much purpose.

I think I'll add onto it though so we can use `log` through the repo for consistent
debug, info, warn, and error messages.

It may also become a good package to include other "shared-utility" logic.

One idea I have is to export a simple command-line UI for the game to help aid development
of the game code itself (without the added networking and UI complexity).
